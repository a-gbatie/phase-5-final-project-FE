# Bonne Nuit - date night app - in progress

This project was created with React/Redux, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails

## General Info
Bonne nuit is a date night app to take the guesswork out of deciding what to watch and where to eat. The user will be able to send a friend request, once both parties have been connected they will be able to swipe left or right on their individual devices until there is a match. Once there is a match that selection will pop up for both parties. 

## Setup
To run this project, run:

```
rails s (for the backend)
npm start (for the frontend) 
```

## Future Features
Bonne Nuit is still a very simple app, as I continue improving on it I will be adding new features. Once I implement the Friendship model relationship, I will add a feature for users to be able to 'star' a selection. Once a selection has been 'starred' it will be pushed to the front of the line so the other user can view it before the other options. Future revisions will include use of restaurant APIs, the user will be able to input their zipcode and surrounding restaurants will be included in their selection queue.
